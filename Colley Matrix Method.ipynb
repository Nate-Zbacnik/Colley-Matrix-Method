    "# Colley's Matrix Method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This is the first in a two part series on Colley's Matrix Method for creating a resume rating system. In this first part we will gain access to Colley's brilliantly clean way to rate the resume of every FBS team in college football. Any system that attempts to rank all 130 FBS teams will have it's problems, but I believe that this is the best system that can be created under Colley's strict rules for keeping our resume ratings unbiased. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part, we'll have some fun and break most of Colley's rules. A resume rating simply attempts to measure what every team has *achieved* relative to one another. It is not concerned with being predictive. In the second part we will introduce some simple priors and hyperparameters to move the resume ratings in the direction of power ratings -- ones that better match common knowledge about the wide range of team ability in college football."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Colley Matrix Method is a resume rating system that was a part of the Official Bowl Championship Series Ranking from 2001 to 2013.  To be a good *resume rating system* means a few things to Colley, as he explains [here](https://www.colleyrankings.com/matrate.pdf):\n",
    "- eliminates any bias toward conference, history or tradition,\n",
    "- eliminates the need to invoke some ad hoc means of deflating runaway scores, and\n",
    "- eliminates any other ad hoc adjustments, such as home/away tweaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these self imposed restrictions, Colley begins by giving every FBS team a starting rating of 1/2 and by taking into account only their wins and losses will arrive at their final rating. What makes his method so powerful is that he uses a simple mathematical method to account for the fact that we don't just want to look at a team's win percentage to rate them. We want to account for *strength of schedule*, the ability of teams played on a given schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider teams A,B and C. If *A* beats *B*, and *B* beats *C*, then we would say that *A* has a transitive win over *C*. It is natural to want to consider transitive wins when ranking teams, because beating a team with a winning record is better than beating a team with no wins at all. In a system that only cares about wins and losses, strength of schedule is simply a proper valuation of transitive wins and losses.  Colley found a way to account for strength of schedule by looking at the complete college picture of who beat whom and who lost to whom. What's amazing is that what sounds like a complicated spider-web of tracing these transitive wins and losses can be completly encapsulated into a simple formula."

    "\n",
    "Colley does an excellent job describing his system and its motivation [here](https://www.colleyrankings.com/matrate.pdf), which I will now abbreviate. This derivation will be very important to us in the second part of this series. Lets consider the following simple rating for a team,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} r = \\frac{1 + n_w}{2+n_{tot}} \\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_w$ is their number of wins, and $n_{tot}$ is the number of games they have played. Notice that a team's rating must be between 0 and 1. A team that has played no games begins with a rating of $ r = \\frac{1+0}{2+0} = \\frac{1}{2}$. If they play 10 games in a season and win 7 they will have a rating of $ r = \\frac{1 + 7}{2+10} = \\frac{2}{3}$. This seems reasonable. Now it just takes a moderate amount of algebra to account for strength of schedule. Let's multiply both sides by the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} (2+ n_{tot}) r = 1 + n_w \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "It wouldn't be algebra without a clever identity, so let's add one now. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} n_w = \\frac{n_w - n_\\ell}{2} + \\frac{n_w + n_\\ell}{2} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We've added a new symbol, $n_\\ell$, the number of losses. Let's now replace $n_w$ in equation (2) with what we have in equation (3) \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} (2+ n_{tot}) r = 1 + \\frac{n_w - n_\\ell}{2} + \\frac{n_w + n_\\ell}{2} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move some stuff to the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} (2+ n_{tot}) r - \\frac{n_w + n_\\ell}{2} = 1 + \\frac{n_w - n_\\ell}{2} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that every game is a win or a loss. $n_{tot} = n_w + n_\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",

    "Bring the $n_{tot}$ terms together on the left hand side.\n",

    "Now remember that multiplication is simply repeated addition. \n",

    "The $\\Sigma$ symbol means we will sum $n_{tot}$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "*whew!* That was a lot of small steps that really added up. Lets take a step back and interpret our equation. If zero games have been played, everything goes away except for $ 2r = 1$ which recovers a rating of $\\frac{1}{2}$. As more games are played, the right hand side either increases or decreases by a half depending on if it is a win or a loss. In order to maintain equality, the rating r on the left hand side has to increase or decrease to match. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the summation on the left hand side is over every game played. For every game we take the difference between the team's rating, *r*, and the average rating of an opponent, $\\frac{1}{2}$. Colley's insight was that instead of taking the difference from the *average* rating, we can actually take the difference from the rating of the teams they have played. In order to do this we need a little more notation. Adding a superscript $i$ will denote that a given symbol pertains to team *i*.\n",

Note that $n^{i,j} = n^{j,i}$, so this matrix is symmetric. The *r* column vector has the ratings we want to calculate, and the column vector after the equals accounts for the total wins and losses. Now all we need to do is build this matrix and use a solver to get those ratings!"
